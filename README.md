Why was using Huggingface's free API call not ideal?

The Flan-T5 models have different token limits for input and output:
- Input sequence length: 2056 tokens
- Output sequence length: 512 tokens

When using the HuggingFace API, I need to set a lower max_length parameter (around 64 tokens) to avoid timeout errors. 

For reference, 512 tokens is approximately equivalent to 400 words and 2056 is 1,600 words

Claude's official metaprompt:
The official metaprompt was about 3.9K words which far suprasses the input sequence length that Huggingface's free API call could provide. Therefore, I had to trim down a few things, namely removing the math and function part of the metaprompt to reach 1,250 words. This leaves approximately 350 words for the input and other considerations.
