# Claude Prompting Tips Extension - Technical Design Document

## Architecture Overview

The extension is built using Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture and consists of several key components:

### 1. Core Components

#### Manifest Configuration (`manifest.json`)
- Uses Manifest V3 for improved security and performance
- Implements side panel functionality for a non-intrusive UI
- Configures permissions conservatively (activeTab, sidePanel, storage)
- Sets up content security policy to allow only necessary connections

#### Background Service (`background.js`)
- Implements event-driven architecture
- Handles side panel activation via message passing
- Lightweight implementation to minimize memory footprint

#### Content Script (`content.js`)
- URL detection for claude.ai
- Triggers side panel opening at appropriate times
- Minimal DOM interaction to prevent conflicts

### 2. Side Panel Implementation

#### HTML Structure (`sidepanel.html`)
- Hierarchical organization using semantic HTML
- Markdown-like syntax for content structure
- Responsive design considerations

#### Prompt Tips Management (`sidepanel.js`)
- Data-driven UI generation
- Category-based organization
- Event delegation for performance
- Sanitization of HTML content
- Clipboard integration for user convenience

### 3. Prompt Enhancement System (`prompt-enhancer.js`)

#### Class Structure
The `PromptEnhancer` class implements:
- Singleton pattern for API key management
- Event-driven architecture for UI interactions
- Asynchronous operations handling
- Error management and user feedback
- API usage monitoring

#### API Integration
- Uses Hugging Face's FLAN-T5 model
- Implements rate limiting consideration
- Handles API responses and errors gracefully
- Manages token limitations effectively

## Design Decisions

### 1. Side Panel Approach
Selected the side panel approach over a popup because:
- Allows persistent visibility while using Claude
- Provides more screen real estate for content
- Enables better organization of extensive tips
- Maintains context while crafting prompts

### 2. Local Storage Strategy
- Uses Chrome's sync storage for API keys
- Implements secure storage patterns
- Maintains user privacy by storing minimal data

### 3. FLAN-T5 Model Selection
Chose FLAN-T5 for prompt enhancement because:
- Good balance of performance and speed
- Suitable token limits for typical prompts
- Available through free API access
- Reliable and well-documented

### 4. Performance Considerations

#### Token Management
- Input limit: 2056 tokens (~1,600 words)
- Output limit: 512 tokens (~400 words)
- Implemented template optimization to maximize usable space

#### UI Optimization
- Event delegation for better performance
- Lazy loading of content
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Efficient category expansion/collapse

### 5. Security Implementation

#### Content Security
- Strict CSP implementation
- Input sanitization
- Secure API key handling
- XSS prevention measures

#### API Security
- Secure key storage
- Key validation before storage
- Error handling for API failures
- Rate limit monitoring

## Technical Limitations

1. API Constraints
- Token limitations affect prompt length
- Rate limiting on free API tier
- Timeout considerations for long prompts

2. Browser Limitations
- Chrome-specific implementation
- Manifest V3 restrictions
- Storage quotas

## Future Improvements

1. Technical Enhancements
- Implement caching for API responses
- Add offline mode capabilities
- Improve error handling granularity
- Implement batch processing for long prompts

2. Architecture Updates
- Consider implementing worker for heavy processing
- Add support for additional AI models
- Implement prompt template system
- Add analytics for usage patterns

3. Performance Optimization
- Implement request queuing
- Add response caching
- Optimize token usage
- Improve UI rendering performance
